# Implement Assignment Remote Service

[$LIFERAY_LEARN_YOUTUBE_URL$]=https://www.youtube.com/embed/0lNvBGjU3Y4

## Exercise Goals

- Declare dependencies
- Implement the facade methods for the local service in the <code>AssignmentServiceImpl.java</code>
- Do a final code review
- Rebuild and deploy the service

</div>
	
## Implement the Façade Methods

1. **Open** the `AssignmentServiceImpl.java` class. The empty class looks like this:

  ```java
  /**
   * Copyright (c) 2000-present Liferay, Inc. All rights reserved.
   *
   * This library is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify it under
   * the terms of the GNU Lesser General Public License as published by the Free
   * Software Foundation; either version 2.1 of the License, or (at your option)
   * any later version.
   *
   * This library is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but WITHOUT
   * ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS
   * FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. See the GNU Lesser General Public License for more
   * details.
   */

  package com.liferay.training.gradebook.service.impl;

  import com.liferay.portal.aop.AopService;
  import com.liferay.training.gradebook.service.base.AssignmentServiceBaseImpl;

  import org.osgi.service.component.annotations.Component;

  /**
   * The implementation of the assignment remote service
   *
   * <p>
   * All custom service methods should be put in this class. Whenever methods are added, rerun ServiceBuilder to copy their definitions into the <code>com.liferay.training.gradebook.service.AssignmentService</code> interface.
   *
   * <p>
   * This is a remote service. Methods of this service are expected to have security checks based on the propagated JAAS credentials because this service can be accessed remotely.
   * </p>
   *
   * @author Brian Wing Shun Chan
   * @see AssignmentServiceBaseImpl
   */
  @Component(
  	property = {
  		"json.web.service.context.name=gradebook",
  		"json.web.service.context.path=Assignment"
  	},
  	service = AopService.class
  )
  public class AssignmentServiceImpl extends AssignmentServiceBaseImpl {

  	/*
  	 * NOTE FOR DEVELOPERS:
  	 *
  	 * Never reference this class directly. Always use <code>com.liferay.training.gradebook.service.AssignmentServiceUtil</code> to access the assignment remote service.
  	 */
  }
  ```

2. **Implement** the façade methods in the class as follows:

  ```java
  public Assignment addAssignment(
    long groupId, String title, String description,
    Date dueDate, ServiceContext serviceContext)
    throws PortalException {
    return assignmentLocalService.addAssignment(
       groupId, title, description, dueDate, serviceContext);
  }
  public Assignment deleteAssignment(long assignmentId)
    throws PortalException {
    Assignment assignment =
       assignmentLocalService.getAssignment(assignmentId);
    return assignmentLocalService.deleteAssignment(assignment);
  }
  public Assignment getAssignment(long assignmentId)
    throws PortalException {
    Assignment assignment =
       assignmentLocalService.getAssignment(assignmentId);
    return assignment;
  }
  public List<Assignment> getAssignmentsByGroupId(long groupId) {
    return assignmentPersistence.findByGroupId(groupId);
  }
  public List<Assignment> getAssignmentsByKeywords(
    long groupId, String keywords, int start, int end,
    OrderByComparator<Assignment> orderByComparator) {
    return assignmentLocalService.getAssignmentsByKeywords(
       groupId, keywords, start, end, orderByComparator);
  }
  public long getAssignmentsCountByKeywords(long groupId, String keywords) {
    return assignmentLocalService.getAssignmentsCountByKeywords(
       groupId, keywords);
  }
  public Assignment updateAssignment(
    long assignmentId, String title, String description,
    Date dueDate, ServiceContext serviceContext)
    throws PortalException {
    return assignmentLocalService.updateAssignment(
       assignmentId, title, description, dueDate, serviceContext);
  }
  ```

## Final Code Review

1. **Resolve** missing imports.
   * Note: You can ignore any errors for unimplemented methods as these should be addressed in later modules. 
2. **Fix** indents and spacing by using automatic code formatting.
3. **Save** the file.

The complete file will look like this:

```java

   }
}
```

## Rebuild and Deploy the Service

1. **Run** the `buildService` Gradle task to regenerate the service.
2. **Start** your Docker container if it's not running.
3. **Run** `../gradlew deploy` to deploy the modules.

You should see a success log message if modules were deployed successfully:

```
2019-03-20 11:31:59.667 INFO  [pipe-start 984][BundleStartStopLogger:39] STARTED com.liferay.training.gradebook.api_1.0.0 [984]
