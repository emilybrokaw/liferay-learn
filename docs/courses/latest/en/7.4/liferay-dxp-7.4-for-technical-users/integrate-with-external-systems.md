## Learning Objectives

* Learn how to make your custom application configurable
* Learn how to implement workflows in your application
* Understand JSON and SOAP web service APIs
* Understand JAX-RS and JAX-WS endpoint publishing

## Tasks to Accomplish

* Test the Gradebook application in the Liferay DXP UI
* Add an Assignment through a JSON API test page
* Delete an Assignment through a JSON API test page

## Exercise Prerequisites

* Java JDK installed to run Liferay
    - Download here: [https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html](https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html)
    - Instructions on installation here: [https://www.java.com/en/download/help/download_options.xml](https://www.java.com/en/download/help/download_options.xml)
* Preferred development tools (e.g. Blade CLI, Gradle, IntelliJ IDEA with Liferay plugin, etc.) installed with the "Gradebook Workspace" already created
    - This was done in the first training module
* Exercise Prereqs added to workspace or previous training modules completed
