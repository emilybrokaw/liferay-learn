# Using Analytics Cloud with Forms to Optimize Evaluation

Content Creators and Administrators can view the Form Entries from within whichever site the Form is located. Going through individual entries might work for a small platform with only a few different Forms, but not for a larger platform, where thousands of users may be filling out each and every Form. In order to take advantage of all that data, the Marketing team needs to be able to view summaries of the data instead of individual Form Entries. This is where Liferay's Analytics Cloud comes in.

## Analyzing Livingstone's Feedback

The Forms created by Josiah and Natalia are meant to be filled out by as many users as possible, so sorting through individual entries manually will take too long. Instead, Natalia wants an easy way of visualizing all the data for every Form she creates. She can then hand that data to her data analysts to provide useful information for Livingstone. Fortunately, Josiah wants to add Liferay's Analytics Cloud to the platform, giving Natalia that functionality.

## Leveraging Asset Data with Liferay Analytics Cloud

Liferay's Analytics Cloud allows Content Creators to see all Form data using the Asset Analytics feature.

After setting up _Liferay Analytics Cloud_ on your platform, you can click on the _Assets_ section of the _Operations_ menu to review data on various assets on the platform.

## Accessing Forms Data with Analytics Cloud

In the _Forms_ tab of the Assets page, you will be able to see all the Forms that exist in a site along with some basic information.

```{important}
Key Point: <br>
The four types of data you can see for each Form in Analytics Cloud are:
<ul>
	<li>Total views</li>
	<li>Total Submissions</li>
	<li>Average Abandonment Rates</li>
	<li>Average Completion Time</li>
</ul>
```

Clicking on a Form from the _Forms_ tab of the Assets page will bring up more details on all the entry data for that particular Form as well as a visual representation of the analytics.

The Analytics Dashboard makes it easy for you to leverage all your user-filled data in the Forms you have created. Analytics Cloud gives you the ability to see exactly who is submitting Forms, from where, and by what means. I.e., you can view submissions by User Segment, by location, and by Technology (OS or Web Browser). Analytics Cloud also gives you the Field Analysis chart, which allows you to see exactly what percentage of users have interacted with each of a Form's fields.
