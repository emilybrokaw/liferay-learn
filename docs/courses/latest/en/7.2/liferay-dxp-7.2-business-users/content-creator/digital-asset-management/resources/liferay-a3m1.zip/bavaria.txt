Bavaria is one of the most popular – and most scenic – travel destinations in Germany. For many, Bavaria is sausage, beer, and lederhosen, and although you’ll find all of that on your vacation, Bavaria has much more to offer.

If you want to escape the crowds and experience the down-to-earth Gemuetlichkeit Bavaria is famous for, make sure to spend time in some rural villages along the way. Stop in a town you never heard of before, head to the “Gasthaus” (restaurant) for some Bavarian fare, buy some goodies in a local store, and take a hike in the surrounding area.
